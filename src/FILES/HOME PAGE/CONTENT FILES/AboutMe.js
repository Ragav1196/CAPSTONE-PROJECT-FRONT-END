      <h1>‚ö° About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hey! I'm Abdul Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early age,
        and been passionate about it ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really liked to build stuff using <span>no-code tools</span> back in 2010, and from
        that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do
        programming in various languages and technologies, and had the privilege
        to worked in a <span>B2B Company</span> and a <span>Recruitment Company</span> I'm interested in
        building something awesome with code and automate tasks with code,
        currently focused on <span>Web & Mobile Development, Open Source</span> and
        <span>Competitive Programming</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on
        Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
