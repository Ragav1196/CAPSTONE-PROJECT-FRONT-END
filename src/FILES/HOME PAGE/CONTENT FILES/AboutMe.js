        <p>
          Hey! I'm Abdul Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early age,
          and been passionate about it ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really liked to build stuff using <span>no-code tools</span> back in
          2010, and from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to
          today, I do programming in various languages and technologies, and had
          the privilege to worked in a <span>B2B Company</span> and a{" "}
          <span>Recruitment Company</span> I'm interested in building something
          awesome with code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on{" "}
          <span>Web & Mobile Development, Open Source</span> and
          <span>Competitive Programming</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on
          Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
